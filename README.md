## Introduction

TextBuddy helps you reach AI instantly. Everyone has a few go-to prompts, and bouncing out of your active window just to retype them in ChatGPT ruins your focus. With one click, TextBuddy gives you the answer right where you are — no context switching, no friction.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add your OpenAI API key  
Open **Settings** and paste your API key (starts with `sk-`). TextBuddy uses this key for AI responses.

### 2. Record your hotkeys  
In the main window, choose **Inline** or **Popup**, then click **Record Hotkey** to set shortcuts usable from any app.

- **Inline** → replaces highlighted text in place  
- **Popup** → shows a floating response window

### 3. Create your presets  
Click **+ Add Preset**, give it a name, and write the instructions you want TextBuddy to follow (translate, rewrite, summarize, etc.).
