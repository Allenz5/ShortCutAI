## Introduction

TextBuddy is built to help you reach AI faster. We all have a few go-to prompts, and jumping out of your current page just to retype them in ChatGPT is pure torture. With one click, TextBuddy gives you what you need without breaking your focus.

## Quick Start

Follow these three quick steps and you'll be rewriting text like a pro.

### Step 1: Add your OpenAI API key

Open Settings and paste your OpenAI key (starts with "sk-"). TextBuddy uses this to talk to the AI.

### Step 2: Record your hotkeys

Go to the main window, pick Inline and Popup, and click "Record Hotkey" to set shortcuts you can press from any app.

- **Inline** → replaces highlighted text
- **Popup** → shows the answer in a window

### Step 3: Create your presets

Select "+ Add Preset", give it a friendly name, and write the instructions you want TextBuddy to follow (translate, fix tone, summarize, etc.).
